## Across the North East and North Cumbria

The NortHFutures consortium has a shared agenda to address unmet health needs, inequalities, and digital exclusion in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) region where there is proportionately high deprivation, child poverty, mental health challenges and a high percentage of people in the population living with multiple long-term conditions.

## Hub Activities

The NortHFutures consortium aims to humanise health-tech through equity, participation, and investment in people.

- Establish the hub as a world-leading research centre that is people-powered and **provides opportunities for all** to engage in digital health and health-tech initiatives;
- **Enhance digital skills training** provision for stakeholders in multiple sectors: Health and Care; Industry; Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise; Local Government; Academia; and in diverse learning and training environments across the region;
- Collaboratively **create a supportive community** of people and organisations working across health and care and in digital technology innovation;
- **Fund scoping research** in the field of Digital Health that addresses regional unmet health and care needs, health inequalities, and digital exclusion;
- **Create opportunities for engagement, networking and entrepreneurship**.

We will:

- Deliver and evaluate digital skills training and development initiatives;
- Develop new community services and technical infrastructure for collaborative data work and for connecting people working in Digital Health in our region and beyond;
- Commission and evaluate scoping research studies that support new collaborations;
- Hold networking events and provide access to resources supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and routes to commercialisation.

Through our joined-up approach, we unite to build ways for populations of all ages to thrive and invest in their possible futures.
