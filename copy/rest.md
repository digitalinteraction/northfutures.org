## Hub Activities

The NortHFutures consortium aims to humanise health-tech through equity, participation, and investment in people.

- Establish the hub as a world-leading research centre that is people-powered and **provides opportunities for all** to engage in digital health and health-tech initiatives;
- **Enhance digital skills training** provision for stakeholders in multiple sectors: Health and Care; Industry; Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise; Local Government; Academia; and in diverse learning and training environments across the region;
- Collaboratively **create a supportive community** of people and organisations working across health and care and in digital technology innovation;
- **Fund scoping research** in the field of Digital Health that addresses regional unmet health and care needs, health inequalities, and digital exclusion;
- **Create opportunities for engagement, networking and entrepreneurship**.

We will:

- Deliver and evaluate digital skills training and development initiatives;
- Develop new community services and technical infrastructure for collaborative data work and for connecting people working in Digital Health in our region and beyond;
- Commission and evaluate scoping research studies that support new collaborations;
- Hold networking events and provide access to resources supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and routes to commercialisation.

Through our joined-up approach, we unite to build ways for populations of all ages to thrive and invest in their possible futures.

## Hub Research Themes

The hub activities are mobilised around four themes that are grounded in evidenced need voiced by our stakeholders:

- Promoting Health & Nutrition for Children & Young People;
- Developing Digital Surgical Pathways;
- Supporting Mental Health & Wellbeing;
- Living & Ageing Well with Multiple Long-term Conditions.
